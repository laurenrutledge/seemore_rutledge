logging.py

This file contains the logging functions for the Seemore Vision Language Model training process.
Specifically, it contains the print statements that are called upon at the end of each epoch /
iteration during the training. The goal of this file was to ensure that model training, validations,
and performance statistics can be consistently tracked and / or referenced throughout the process.
